# Bezier-Nearest-Point
A quick and dirty (though sorta tested) port of the Graphics Gems volume 1 algorithm describing a Bezier Curve Nearest point algorithm.

For a CAD program I'm writing, I was in need of an algorithm which can tell me how far my mouse pointer was from the objects on the screen. One option I had available was to flatten the bezier curve into line segments and search for the nearest segment. This was less than optimal in my opinion since it would require a ridiculous amount of cycles to perform even if I cached the flattened line segments. So, instead, after what I must admit was a ridiculous amount of Googling I found this algorithm. I don't fully understand how it works as I'm not really a math geek, but my initial testing shows it does work after a few hours of porting. 

Warning. The code has been "Cleaned up" as I was porting so that I could make "Intelligent" porting decisions. There is still some ugliness that I'm not likely to bother with unless I find it's impeding my program from operating. As with all good open source code, I'm re-releasing the code originally found at https://github.com/erich666/GraphicsGems/blob/master/gems/NearestPoint.c with no guarantees or warrantees or any promises what-so-ever. If I fix it for my own personal needs, I'll update the code. I've left all the comments in the code from earlier. I have not properly NDoc'ed the code since I'm not personally concerned by it.
